Because I dont have any other solution now... sorry to bother you this way...

Hi, so it's clearly not a pull request, more like a call for help...
I'm the developer of a tool that convert songs of Groove Coaster from one platform to another, currently working from arcade and mobile to switch perfectly fine.

As I see your addition to bemanipatcher, I naturally get that you have access to decrypted content of GC 4EX, and I'm really so tired to look for it to work with all those files to see if we can port them on another platform...

So I'm here to ask you in hope that you see this message, could you please contact me and help me to find this HDD dump ?
Thank you for the read, in hope that it will lead to something great for Groove Coaster players ^^

Here's my junk e-mail address if you don't want to publicly help for this sort of thing : sonicmegacollection@hotmail.com

Thanks again ^^
